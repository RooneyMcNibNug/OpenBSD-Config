# Packages in OpenBSD
---

## Package System
After using OpenBSD's package system for a while, you will hopefully be pleased with its simplicity. Personally, I find it easier and straight-forward compared even to systems like APT.

## Mirrors
There are a number of mirrors that act as a hosted directories for OpenBSD packages available to choose from. These are simply repos to install applications to your workstation. On my latest install, the default mirror configured during install was  	https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/. You can either keep your installed mirror, or edit the ```/etc/installurl``` on your workstation to include another mirror of your choice (please consider only using mirrors with TLS!)
