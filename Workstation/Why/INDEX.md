## Why do I want to use OpenBSD as a workstation?
---
At first run, OpenBSD can seem intimidating, especially for the 
unfamiliar.

As someone who took the dive into linux as a self-learner, trying 
OpenBSD for the first time was a bit confusing. Luckily, the manual 
pages for OpenBSD are notoriusly robust. 
 
There are a lot of advantages to using OpenBSD in general, but through 
time it seems to have become more apt as a workstation OS in many 
occasions.

# Stability
OpenBSD is often evangalized as one of the soundest "works out of the 
box" systems, and I tend to agree. A big part of this is probaly the 
"less code, less problems" development mindset behind the OS.

Another factor of stability is the fact that OpenBSD runs great on a lot 
of different architectures, as well as older hardware and within virtual 
machines. I've been running the OS on both a VirtualBox instance and an 
older T-series Thinkpad with almost zero problems for a combined couple 
of years now.
